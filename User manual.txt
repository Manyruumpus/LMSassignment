User Manual for the LMS System

Although the system is quite user-friendly, this manual is provided in case you encounter any problems while exploring the LMS.

Login Process:

Select User Class:
Use the up and down arrow keys to choose the user class you belong to.

Enter Credentials:
Type your user ID and password. You have only three tries; after three incorrect attempts, the program will terminate.

Access Options:
Once you enter the correct credentials, an option menu tailored to your user class will appear. Use the arrow keys to navigate and select an option.

For Students and Faculty:

Borrow Book:

You can borrow a book if it is available.
If the book is unavailable, you can reserve it. Once the current user returns the book, it will automatically be assigned to your user ID.
If the book is already reserved, you will have to wait until it is returned.
Return Book:

To return a book, enter the ISBN.
A fine will be calculated based on the due date and the return date. The fine amount will be displayed and stored in your account.
View Books and Fines:

This option allows you to see the list of books and any fines on your account.
Pay Fine:

You cannot see your fine amount in this option; you must view it in the previous option.
To pay the fine, you must type your user ID. You have only three tries; otherwise, you will be returned to the previous menu.
Exit:

Terminate the program.
For Librarians:

The code is self-explanatory for librarians.
